javaConcepts
============

A beginner's guide to Java Programming language.
<ul>
<li>Basic constructs and syntax of the language described </li>
<li>Comment lines added in most places to describe almost everything</li>
<li>Skim the repo for a quick revision on the language</li>
<li>Updated frequently (most probably :P )</li>
</ul>

This is repo may simple and silly , but it may actually help out few students and language learners.<br/>

Feel free to contribute :) <br/>
