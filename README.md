javaConcepts
============

A beginner's guide to Java Programming language.

=>Basic constructs and syntax of the language described 
=>Comment lines added in most places to describe almost everything
=>Skim the repo for a quick revision on the language
=>Updated frequently (most probably :P )


This is repo may simple and silly , but it may actually help out few students and language learners.

Feel free to contribute :) 

Cheers!
