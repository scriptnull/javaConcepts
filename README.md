============

A beginner's guide to Java Programming language.
<ul>
<li>Basic constructs and syntax of the language described vividly.</li>
<li>Comment lines added in most places to describe almost everything.</li>
<li>Skim the repo for a quick revision on the language.</li>
<li>Useful Links and must reads are provided. ( <a href="../master/UsefulLinks.md">Check Out </a> )</li>
<li>Updated frequently (most probably :P )</li>

</ul>

This is repo may seem simple and silly , but it may actually help out few students and language learners.<br/>
